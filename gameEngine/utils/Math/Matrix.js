    Linear transformation is a function with lineal rules
    transformation - function

    Linear:
    1. Lines remain lines
    2. Origin remains fixed

    Grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaces

    2x2 Matrix. Columns define basis vector (i, j)

    [[ix, jx], [iy, jy ]]

    Multiplying a vector by a matrix allows you to understand
    what the transformation does with the vector
